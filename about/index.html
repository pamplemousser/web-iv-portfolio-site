      <p>Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I'll alert the crew. Besides, you look good in a dress. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Talk about going nowhere fast. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I'll be sure to note that in my log. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. Iwould *never* do that to you. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Computer, lights up! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? They were just sucked into space. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Computer, belay that order. Damage report! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. What? We're not at all alike! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.</p>
      <div id="cats"></div>
      <p>This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! We have a saboteur aboard. The game's not big enoughunless it scares you a little. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise."</p>
      <p>I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I am your worst nightmare! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns.In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores. </p>
      <p>Cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. </p>
      <p>You can't give orders around here. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.</p>
      <p>We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Not if I weaken first. The unexpected is our normal routine. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Travel time to the nearest starbase? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. </p>
